Added XSS fix from PloneHotfix20210518 for inline diff.
See `vulnerability <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20210518/xss-vulnerability-in-cmfdifftool>`_.
The first version of the hotfix escaped all html.
Now for the rich text field, use the safe html transform, otherwise the inline diff is no longer inline.
